# ColorClock
a real-time, functioning clock, plus a feature that changes background color based on time of day.

One file is just the clock. A real-time clock counting hours, minutes and seconds. 

The second file is the same clock, but with a function that takes the current time, converts it into a hexa code for colors, then displays that color as the background color.
